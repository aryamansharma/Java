core Java:
1. to print we use System.out.print();
2. semi-colon at the end is important;
3. whenever we want to print string we pass them in double quotes("") not in single quotes('');
    eg : 
        * System.out.print('hello world'); // Not acceptable.
        * System.out.print("Hello world"); // acceptable.
4. to run java code there are 2 steps : // make sure to run these 2 commands in the folder where your Java file is.
    1. compile : javac filename.java
    2. run : java classname // without file extension
5. structure of a Java program : 
    class Hello { // classname should always be starting with capital
    public static void main(String a[]) { // this String argument is very important
            System.out.print("hello workd");
        }
    }

6. How a Java code is run : 
    1. we write the code in Java.
    2. that java code is converted to byte code by compiler when we run javac filename.java
    3. after compilation a file is created with classname of the class containing the main method.
    4. run java classname
    5. that code is executed on JVM, which is installed in our machine.

7. some core points about Java : 
    1. Java is platform independent.
    2. JVM is platform dependent.
    3. the main method is entry point of a code which is required by JVM, without this main method the code will not run. 
        this is like a starting point of our program.
    4. basically a device hardware will be having the OS,
        and on that OS we install JDK which will be containing JRE(Java Runtime Environment) which will be containg the JVM.
    5. JRE contains JVM and libraries and Runtime.

8. difference between print and println is that println prints the output in a different line while print prints the output in a single line.
    for eg : 
        for println : 
            System.out.println("Hello world!");  
            System.out.println("Hello world!");
        output : 
            Hello world!
            Hello world!
        for print : 
            System.out.print("Hello world!");
            System.out.print("Hello world!");
        output : 
            Hello world!Hello world!

9. Data types:
    primitive data types : 
        1. integers :
            integer types : int, byte, short, long
            NOTE : while workign with long we need to put 'l' at the end,
                like this : long num = 1223l;
        2. float : 
            float types : double, float
            NOTE : while working with float type values, double is the default data type for Java. 
                    double num = 5.6; // this is valid
                    float num = 5.6; // this is invalid  
                so if you want to create a variable with float data type, you have to do something like this :
                    float num = 5.6f;
        3. characters : it can only store a single character.
            character type : char
            NOTE : char only accepts single quotes(''), it will not accept double quotes(""), they are for strings.
        4. boolean :
            boolean type : bool
            NOTE : boolean only accepts true and false, no 1 or 0.

        Note : primitive data types always starts with small characters like, int, char, bool, long etc.
    
10. Literals: literals are just values of a variable.
    1. int a = 10_00_000; // this is valid in Java.
        System.out.println(a);
        output : 1000000;
    
    2. public static void main(String[] args) {
        char c = 'a';
        c++; // this c++ will increment the 'a' to 'b';
        System.out.println(c++); // this c++ will increment the 'b' to 'c';
        System.out.println(c);
        }

    3. if we do something like this : 
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            double num = 56;
            System.out.println(num);
        }

        output : 56.0 // double will convert the 56 to 56.0;

11. type casting and conversion :
    1. when we explicitly convert the type it is known as type casting.
        eg : byte a = 2;
             int b = 1;
             a=b; // this will not work byte range is smaller than int.
             a = (byte) b; // type casting
             b=a; // this will work because byte range is smaller than int.
    2. when we implicitly convert the type it is known as type conversion.
            byte a = 2;
            int b = 1;
            b=a; // type conversion.
    3. type promotion : when automatically converts the type of a lower data type type to higher data type while evaluating an expression : 
        byte a = 10;
        byte b = 30;
        int result = a * b; // this will give 300 of int because of type promotion.

    Note : 
        1.
            float num = 5.6f;
            int a = 5;
            a = num; // this will throw an error because we cannot assign a float value to an int.
            a = (int) num; type casting. 
            System.out.println(a);
            output : 5; // it will lose the decimal part of the number.  
        2.    
            byte a = 2;
            int b = 257;
            a = (byte) b;
            System.out.println(a);
            output : 1 // because it will perform a modulus operation with 256.

12. relational operators : 
    1. for equality check we use : '=='
        eg : int a = 1;
             int b = 2;
             System.out.println(a==b); 
             output : true;

13. if else :
    1. Java is not an identation depent language.
    2. if we have 1 line of code to execute in an if or else block we can skip curly braces but if we have more than line of code in any of the if or else block we need to use curly braces. just like Javascript
        eg : 

            if(true) System.out.println('a');
            else System.out.println('b');

            if(true) {
                System.out.println('a');
                System.out.println('b');
            } else {
                System.out.println('c');
                System.out.println('d');
            }
