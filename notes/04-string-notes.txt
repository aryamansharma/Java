String in java:
1. String should always be in double quotes("").
2. char should always be in single quotes('').
3. string are also created in heap memory just like objects.
4. defining a string : 
    class demo {
        public static void main(String a[]) {
            // this String keyword here is basically a class. 
            // this name variable will be holding the address of this string behind the scenes.
            String name = "aryaman"; // this way of creating string is more used.

            // we can create a string like this as well
            String name2 = new String("ABC");
        }
    }

5. some string methods :
    1. name.charAt(1); // this will give the char at 1st index of the name string.
    2. name.concat(" sharma"); // this concat method will join 2 strings.
        * output : aryaman sharma   

6. some important points :
    * in heap there is something known as string constant pool which is used to created string.
    * when we something like this :
        String name = "aryaman";

        * we are creating an object of this string with value "aryaman" and that object is bieng stored in the string constant pool.
            and this name variable will be having the address of that object.

        After this suppose we do something like these:

        // this step will delete older object from string constant pool with value "aryaman" and 
            create a new one with value "aryaman sharma" and name variable will point to that new object.
        name = name + " sharma";

        * these s1 and s2 both will be pointing to 1 object, they will create 2 different with same values.
        String s1 = "Aryaman";
        String s2 = "Aryaman";

    * by default strings are immutable, meaning their values cannot be change.

7. we can create mutable strings as well, meaning we can change the string by using StringBuffer class.
    * this is how we create a StringBuffer :
        StringBuffer name = new StringBuffer("aryaman");

    * we have different methods we can use on StringBuffer.

    * the initial capacity of a StringBuffer is 16 characters.

8. for comparing strings we use equals() method.
