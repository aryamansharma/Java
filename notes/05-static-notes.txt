1. static variables:
    * if we make a instance variable as static, 
    then that variable value will be shared will all the objects of that class with that single value.
    and if we update that static variable value, then all the objects will be having the updated value of that variable.

    * creating and updating a static variable : 
    class Phone {
        String brand;
        int price;

        //static variable
        static String type;
    }

    class Main {
        public static void main(String a[]) {
            //updating the static variable value
            Phone.type = "smartPhone";

            Phone obj1 = new Phone();
            obj1.brand = "Apple";
            obj1.price = 1500;
        }
    }

2. static methods:
    * if we create a method as static then we dont need to create an instance of that class to call that we directly call with the help of class.
    * we cannot access non staitic variables inside static method.

    creating and using static method :
    class Phone {
        String brand;
        int price;

        //static variable
        static String type;


        public static void show(Phone obj) {
            // we have to pass the obj in the static method to get the non static values inside static methods.
            System.out.println(obj.brand+": "+obj.price+": "+type);
        }
    }

    class Main {
        public static void main(String a[]) {
            //updating the static variable value
            Phone.type = "smartPhone";

            Phone obj1 = new Phone();
            obj1.brand = "Apple";
            obj1.price = 1500;
            Main.show(obj1);
        }
    }

3. static block:
    * static block is used to initialize static variables.
    * some important points :
        * basically when we create an object of an class there are 2 steps:
            1. class is loaded : basically there is a class loader inside JVM which will be containg all the classes when an object is created of that of that class,
                and this is just a 1 time step, after that if we create another object of that class then this class does not need to be loaded, it is already loade.
            2. object is created.

        * so when the class is loaded, the static method is called for just 1 time when the class is loaded for the 1st time, after that it is not called.
            and the static method is first method called even before constructor.

        * if we want to just call the static method of a class without creating an object we can use the Class class:
            Class.forName("Phone") // here Phone is the class name.

    * defining a static method : 
    class Phone {
        String brand;
        int price;

        //static variable
        static String type;

        // static block
        static {
            type = "phone";
        }
    }

4. static class : 
    * for static class we dont need to create an object of that class.
    * we can only make an inner class as a static class.
