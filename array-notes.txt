Array in Java:
1. to create an array in java we do it like this :
    int nums[] = {1,2,3}; // here nums is the name of the array.
    System.out.println(nums); // [1,2,3];

2. if we want to create an array dynamically we can do something like this :
    int nums[] = new int[4]; // this will create an array of length 4 with all the values as 0;
    System.out.println(nums); // [0,0,0,0];

3. suppose we have an array like this : 
    int nums[] = [1,2,3,4];

    if we want to print the entire array, we cannot do System.out.println. 
    we have to use for loop for printing each element of an array.
    eg :
        for(int i = 0;i<nums.length;i++){
            System.out.println(nums[i]);
        }

4. multidimensional array :
    1. creating 1D array :
        int num[] = {1,2,3,4};
    
    2. creating 2D array " 
        int num[][] = new int[3][4]; // this means the num array will be of lenght 3 and each element will be an array of lenght 4.

5. enhanced for loop:
    * For 1D array :
        int[] arr = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 };
        for (int a : arr) {
                // here a will be each element of the arr array.
                System.out.println(a);
        }
    * For 2D array : 
        public static void main(String a[]) {
            int nums[][] = new int[3][4];
            for(int num[] : nums) {
                for(int num2 : num){
                    System.out.print(num2+" ");
                }
                System.out.println("");
            }
        }

6. suppose in the 2D array we dont know what will be the lenght of the element array, it can be anything, 
    meaning all the array elements of the outer array will not be having the same lenght, so they are called Jagged array.
    they are defined like this :

    int nums[][] = new int[1][]; // we dont need to specify the lenght in the second bracket.

7. we can create 3D array as well :
   int num[][][] = new int[3][2][2];

8. Array is created in heap memory.

9. once we declare an array with a size, we canot change the size again.

10. we cannot store different types of data like int, char as elements in a single array.

11. Array of objects :

class Student {
    int rollNo;
    String name;
    int marks;
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String a[]) {
        Student s1 = new Student();
        s1.rollNo = 1;
        s1.name="sexy j";
        s1.marks=89;

        Student s2 = new Student();
        s2.rollNo = 2;
        s2.name="chutad aurat";
        s2.marks=79;

        Student s3 = new Student();
        s3.rollNo = 3;
        s3.name="maa ki chut";
        s3.marks=89;

        // this line will not create objects itself, we have to create objects manually,
        but it will create an array which holds the referrence to the objects of Student class.
        Student students[] = new Student[3]; 

        we manually have to assign the objects in the particular index of the array.
        students[0] = s1;
        students[1] = s2;
        students[2] = s3;
        
        for(Student student : students) {
            System.out.println(student.name+" : "+student.marks);
        }

        //if we try to print the object directly, like this
        System.out.println(s1); //this will not give the object but it will give the address of the object.
    }
}
